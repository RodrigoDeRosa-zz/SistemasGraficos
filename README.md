# Sistemas Graficos

JavaScript application running on WebGL library that creates a 3D scene in a web browser.

This application was developed as a project for a Computer Graphics course at the University of Buenos Aires. The objective was to create a 3D scene where a city would be dynamically created on load. All drawing techniques can be found in the code as well as camera dynamics, texture settings and shader coding.

* The drawing techniques used were Sweep and Revolt, both methods developed from the ground up can be found [here](https://github.com/RodrigoDeRosa/SistemasGraficos/tree/master/SurfaceCreation).
* Camera code can be found [here](https://github.com/RodrigoDeRosa/SistemasGraficos/tree/master/Cameras).
* Shader code can be found [here](https://github.com/RodrigoDeRosa/SistemasGraficos/tree/master/Utils/Shaders).

Some demo images of the final result can be found [here](https://github.com/RodrigoDeRosa/SistemasGraficos/tree/master/Demos).
